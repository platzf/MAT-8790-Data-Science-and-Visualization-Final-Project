# MAT-8790-Data-Science-and-Visualization-Final-Project
For my graduate-level Data Science &amp; Visualization course, I analyzed historical restaurant menus dating back to 1851, to detect trends in food popularity as well as price trends.

The data comes from the New York Public Library's Rare Books Division, where they are currently in the process of transcribing all their historical menus into digital data. For more information about this initiative and to see the entire online gallery of menus, check out http://menus.nypl.org.

The actual data sets I used to read into R came from data.world, found here: https://data.world/data-society/discover-the-menu. There are four .csv files to download, and they all play a part in describing each menu. I merged these data sets accordingly in my R code.
